<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

We all know the videos where people are just using commands like !gen or !i to inspect potential crafts or existing skins. 
I've found out about broskins server somewhat later and since I have a own server for me and the boys (Mainly for practice mode) I thought it would be nice to have this feature there too.

I thought I could just grab a plugin online and use it but I didnt find a good one that I like.

With the help of existing skin changer plugins from kgns:
- https://github.com/kgns/weapons
- https://github.com/kgns/gloves

I managed to create my own version of it named - phoskin -
The codebase is not the best I've made in my life, but its just a small plugin so what. Feel free to make pullrequest to change that!

### Important

Valve changed rate limits. csgofloat currently blocks automatic requests from their public api. Maybe they will change it again. Currently you have to host your own version of csgofloat to use skin generation from inspect urls. 
Read more about it here:
  - https://github.com/csgofloat/inspect/issues/131
  - https://twitter.com/csgofloat/status/1648717278589112320?s=20

How to host your own version of csgofloat:
  - https://github.com/csgofloat/inspect#how-to-install

You need to switch the url in the plugin via the convar pho_inspect_url.
Put the following line into your server.cfg:
`pho_inspect_url "https://your_endpoint.de"`

Keep in mind that this convar is only read on plugin start. So you have to restart the plugin after changing the convar.


### Features

- Generate skins with the known `!gen` and `!gengl` commands
- Edit skins directly with some helper commands e.g. changing the seed with `!pho seed` (See more under commands)
- Generate any skin from an inspect url by just pasting the url into the chat.

- This plugin does not save any skin to play with it multiple rounds and it will stay like this! This is not a classical skin changer. Its for previewing skins!

### Upcoming Features

There are existing convars but they are not really implemented yet. this is a thing I will work on if I find time for it.

You have an idea?
Submit it [here](https://github.com/araynimax/phoskin/issues).

### Dependecies

- ptah: https://ptah.zizt.ru/
- ripext: https://github.com/ErikMinekus/sm-ripext
- This plugin depends on the csgofloat api to generate skins from inspect urls

### Installation

Info: WS plugins and glove plugins could make problems! I did not test it with them active so you have to find out.

0. Make sure you have installed the depedencies. (See Dependecies)
1. Take a look into the [release section](https://github.com/araynimax/phoskin/releases) and download the newest version of phoskin
2. Unzip the Zip-file in the servers "csgo" folder
3. Have fun
